# CS251_Project5
One of the projects that I worked on while taking CS 251

mymap.h: This is a implementation file that contains all the proper functions that are tested in the .cpp file.  

myrandom.h: An implementation file that is meant for grading. Created by Professor Koehler. 

tests.cpp: A test file that tests every function that was created in mymap.h.
